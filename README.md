## Additional Info / Credits

- This AddOn uses the public DeathNotificationLib provided by [Deathlog](https://github.com/aaronma37/Deathlog) to receive character notifications. The DeathNotificationLib (essentially) sends out a broadcast when it detects a character death and RipBozo hooks into those broadcasts and scans for names added to the Watchlist.

- Some animation logic borrowed from [Twitch Emotes v2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/twitch-emotes-v2)
