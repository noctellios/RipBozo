# RipBozo
WoW Classic Hardcore Addon to watch the Deathlog for a specific character's demise.

Does *NOT* require the Deathlog addon to also be installed. Provided a Deathlog addon from someone on the server records the death, RipBozo should pick it up.

## Installation

Download and extract RipBozo.zip into World of Warcraft/\_classic_era\_/Interface/AddOns

## Usage

Slash commands for options panel: /rb, /ripbozo

### Options

- Enable
- Enable Sounds
- Select a sound to play
- Test Alert
    - May click and drag the test alert to set the position
- Add Watchlist character name and optional comment

## Additional Info / Credits

- This AddOn uses the public DeathNotificationLib provided by [Deathlog](https://github.com/aaronma37/Deathlog) to receive character notifications. The DeathNotificationLib (essentially) sends out a broadcast when it detects a character death and RipBozo hooks into those broadcasts and scans for names added to the Watchlist.

- Some animation logic borrowed from [Twitch Emotes v2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/twitch-emotes-v2)
